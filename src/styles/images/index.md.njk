Avoid using images for unnecessary decoration. Only use images if there’s a real user need.

Make sure any information contained in an image can be understood by someone who cannot see it. Also consider partially sighted users with visual impairments and the assistive technologies they might use.

This guidance is for government teams that build online services. To learn how to use images as a GOV.UK content publisher, go to [GOV.UK content guidance for images](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/images).

## Using images to give information

Services usually work best without relying on images. Focus on writing clear, simple content for your service first.

Adding images can sometimes help users better understand instructions. However, images should only be visual aids — written content must contain all the information the user needs to complete the service.

If you choose to add an image to your service, you’ll need to carefully decide if the image needs to be described with alternative text (alt text).

## Photography

Use photography when it’s important to show a lifelike representation of something. For example, showing a photo of a document a user has uploaded.

Do not use photography to represent abstract concepts, such as to convey an impression or emotion to the user. Avoid using generic stock photography in your service.

## Illustrations

Use illustrations to show a simplified image of something complex. For example:
- to demonstrate a physical interaction, like scanning a passport
- to help users find something on a document, like a reference number

### Creating illustrations

Use as few visual elements as possible to communicate your message.

Start by using the [GOV.UK colour palette](/styles/colour/#colour-palette). If you need more colours, try to use tints of the colour palette.

Use flat blocks of colour. Avoid using shadows or gradients, except when needed to show a distinctive feature of an object or to communicate layering or depth.

If creating multiple illustrations for a service, use consistent colours, line widths and border radiuses across them all.

Avoid depicting people in illustrations. If you need to show people, think carefully about how you represent the people that use your service — do not only show one kind of person. 
For example, only depicting people of a particular age, gender or ethnicity can exclude people, reinforce negative stereotypes and cause harm.

Some examples of illustrations from services:

## Icons

Avoid using icons in most cases. People can understand icons to mean different things, so they can be confusing.

Icons can be more useful in case working systems, where users are familiar with the interface and return to it frequently. In this context, they can help users to scan pages more quickly. In most cases it’s still helpful to include a text label alongside any icons.

Do not use a single icon to represent more than one thing. For example, the search icon (magnifying glass) should only be used for search functionality, and not also for screen magnification.

## Avoid images that contain text

Use written content instead of an image that contains text, wherever possible.

Any text inside an image will be difficult to read, especially for users that need to read text using:
- screen readers
- copy and paste
- highlight
- resize
- recolour

However, text can sometimes be an inseparable part of an image, especially in photography. Examples of this might be a photo with a signpost in it, or a company's name on the side of a building.

If you choose to use an image that contains text, you should also include written content nearby that conveys the same meaning. This means the information is available to everyone

Only use alt text as a last resort, when you need to use an image with text that cannot be removed, replaced or supplemented by written content. Be sure to follow the guidance on this page about writing good alt text.

### Avoid images of text

Images of text are usually unnecessary. Where possible, you should replace them with alternatives.

Examples of unnecessary images could include:
- a post from social media
- an excerpt from a document
- a screenshot from a presentation

If you do use an image of text, remember to have written content nearby that conveys the same meaning.

#### Exceptions

There are specific types of images where the exact appearance of the text in the image is essential to its purpose. For example, a logo or a handwritten memo.

These types of images must include alt text, but equivalent written content nearby is not required.

However, you should still try to replace it when possible.

### Possible alternatives

If it's not practical to avoid using an image that contains text (and replace it with written content), there’s a few other ways to replace it.

In any case, make sure that the contrast ratio of text colour and all portions of the image that overlap the text [meets level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum).

#### Show HTML text over an image

You could place HTML text so that it shows over the image.

You’ll still need to make sure there is enough contrast, between the text colour and all portions of the image that overlap the text, on all screen sizes.

#### Use a vector graphic image file

You could create the image and text as a vector graphic, such as an SVG file. This ensures that any text stays readable when the user zooms in. Otherwise, text can become pixelated or unreadable.

Remember to follow the guidance on contrast ratios.

## Alt text

Alternative text, or alt text, is read out by screen readers or displayed if an image does not load or if images have been switched off.

All images should include the alt attribute, even if it’s left empty without alt text (`alt=""`).

### When to use alt text

Only add alt text when you need to describe visual details you cannot practically include in the written content.

There are some cases when an empty `alt=""` attribute is more appropriate. These include:

- a decorative image that does not include important content
- an icon with a text label, where the alt text would repeat the text label
- an image used in a link, where the image is not needed to understand the link

To decide if an image needs alt text, see the [Web Accessibility Initiative alt decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/).

### Writing good alt text

Good alt text:

- tells people what information the image provides
- describes the content and function of the image
- is specific, meaningful and concise

Use normal punctuation, like commas and full stops, so the text is easy to read and understand.

Generally, aim for no more than 2 sentences of alt text.

Do not write alt text that:

- includes the name of the photographer or person who created the image
- starts with ‘Image of’, ‘Graphic of’ or common information that would repeat across every image
- repeats information from the page
- includes extra information not in the image
